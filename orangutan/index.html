It is indeed an exceeding opportunity. However, it is most unfortunate that it is out of my reach to give you an advice, or a lecture on a particular subject you might be interested in. I am most sorry, that my time for you is so brief. However, here is a little thought that you might find useful. A thousand thanks for your time, and, above all, for the cheering and comforting presence of yours.<p>Believe only half of what you see and nothing that you hear.<p class=s>Yours,<br>Edgar Allan Poe</article>
