   <h1>The Raven</h1>
    <h2><span>by</span> Edgar Allan Poe</h2>

   <p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
   Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
   While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
   As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—<br>
   “ ’Tis some visiter,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
   <span class=ind>Only this and nothing more.”</span>

   <p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>
   And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
   Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
   From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
   For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
   <span class=ind>Nameless <i>here</i> for evermore.</span>

   <p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>
   Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>
   So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br>
   “ ’Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>
   Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>
   <span class=ind>This it is and nothing more.”</span>

   <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>
   ”Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>
   But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>
   And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>
   That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br>
   <span class=ind>Darkness there and nothing more.</span>

   <p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>
   Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>
   But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>
   And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br>
   This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”<br>
   <span class=ind>Merely this and nothing more.</span>

   <p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>
   Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.<br>
   “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;<br>
   Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—<br>
   Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—<br>
   <span class=ind>’Tis the wind and nothing more!”</span>

   <p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>
   In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>
   Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>
   But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—<br>
   Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—<br>
   <span class=ind>Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</span>

   <p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
   By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>
   “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,<br>
   Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<br>
   Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<br>
   <span class=ind>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</span>

   <p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>
   Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;<br>
   For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>
   Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—<br>
   Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>
   <span class=ind>With such name as “Nevermore.”</span>

   <p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>
   That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>
   Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—<br>
   Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—<br>
   On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”<br>
   <span class=ind>Then the bird said “Nevermore.”</span>

   <p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>
   “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store<br>
   Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>
   Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br>
   Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>
   <span class=ind>Of ‘Never—nevermore.’ ”</span>

   <p>But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>
   Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>
   Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>
   Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—<br>
   What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore<br>
   <span class=ind>Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</span>

   <p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>
   To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;<br>
   This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>
   On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,<br>
   But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,<br>
   <span class=ind><i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!</span>

   <p>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>
   Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>
   “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee<br>
   Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;<br>
   Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”<br>
   <span class=ind>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</span>

   <p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br>
   Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>
   Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—<br>
   On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—<br>
   Is there—<i>is</i> there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”<br>
   <span class=ind>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</span>

   <p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>
   By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—<br>
   Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>
   It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
   Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”<br>
   <span class=ind>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</span>

   <p>“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—<br>
   “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!<br>
   Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>
   Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!<br>
   Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”<br>
   <span class=ind>Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</span>

   <p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, <i>still</i> is sitting<br>
   On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>
   And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,<br>
   And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>
   And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>
   <span class=ind>Shall be lifted—nevermore!</span>
